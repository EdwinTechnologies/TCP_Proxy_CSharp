# TCP Proxy C#
A TCP-Socket-Based Proxy [with PwnAdventure3 Packet Scanner] [C#/.NET]


## How To?

```
- To run the program you need to compile it with .NET or Mono
  (better than just downloading the binary if you want to modify the code)

- At the top of the Main-Script (TCP_Proxy.cs) you can configure the Proxy-Settings

- If you turn on "Inject-Mode" you can easily inject packets in form of Hex-Strings

```

## PwnAdventure3

```

  - Set the bool "PwnAdventure3" at the top of the "TCP_Proxy.cs" to true
  - The whole Packet-Analyzer is contained in the "ProxyIO.cs"

```
