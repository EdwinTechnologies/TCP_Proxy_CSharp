# TCP_Proxy_CSharp
A TCP-Socket-Based Proxy [with PwnAdventure3 Packet Scanner] [C#/.NET]


## How To?

```
- To run the program you need to compile it with .NET or Mono
  (more recommended than just downloading the binary)

- At the top of the Main-Script (TCP_Proxy.cs) you can configure the **Proxy-Settings**

- If turn on "Inject-Mode" you can easily inject packets in form of Hex-Strings

```

## PwnAdventure3

```

  - Set the bool "PwnAdventure3" at the top of the "TCP_Proxy.cs" to true
  - The whole Packet-Analyzer is contained in the "ProxyIO.cs"
  - Adjust the script as you like

```
